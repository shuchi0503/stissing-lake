    <p>PINE PLAINS — A diving team installed a specialized mat to begin creating a new swimming access point at Stissing Lake on Sunday, the latest effort in an ongoing community battle to remove invasive species and maintain water quality at the town’s popular recreation site.</p>

    <p>The Pine Plains Conservation Advisory Council hired the team to remove invasive weeds and install a polymer mat that will create a weed-free swimming path beyond the lifeguarded beach area. The project builds on volunteer efforts that included hand-pulling water chestnuts after the June 21 Stissing Triathlon.</p>

    <p>The project addresses both recreational access and environmental concerns. Previously, swimmers entered the lake at various self-determined points without town-approved guidance on safety or depth. The designated access point provides official entry with improved parking access through the recreation center lot.</p>

    <p>The CAC purchased the barrier and initial weed removal for $1,200 using funds from the town-alloted CAC budget, according to Kim Denardis, a member of the CAC and co-president of the Stissing Lake Association. The town is working to establish an agreement with a contractor to oversee future seasonal installations and removals.</p>

    <p>Dave Kullgren, a Connecticut police chief and owner of C and D Underwater Maintenance, led the three-hour operation with his son Cam and son’s friend Luke Libero, both in high school. The team used water rakes and garden hoes to remove weeds, filling eight 55-gallon barrels halfway with vegetation before dumping it along the lake’s edge to dry out.</p>

    <p>“This makes the lake more usable,” Kullgren said. “Swimmers can get out to the free water without the nuisance of going through thick gross weeds where fish and snakes like to hide. Now they have a clean path.”</p>

    <p>The 10-by-40-foot “benthic barrier” is a mat made of a polymer material that blocks sunlight from reaching the floor at the bottom of the lake, preventing unwanted aquatic plant growth. It was laid 20 feet from shore and is secured with nine weighted rebar anchors. It’s heavy weight, around 100 pounds,  would help ensure that it remains in place all summer long.</p>

    <p>The benthic barrier will be installed in late spring or early summer each year and removed in fall for cleaning and winter storage. With proper maintenance, it should last seven to 10 years.</p>

    <p>While clearing the water was an important step, the town Parks and Recreation department is still reviewing fencing bids and finalizing signage plans. Director Brian Coons said the department will likely have an update on the opening date in the next couple of weeks.</p>

    <h5>Fighting Invasive Species</h5>

    <p>The swimming access project represents one front in a broader battle against three invasive plant species threatening the lake's ecosystem: water chestnuts, curly pondweed and Eurasian milfoil.</p>

    <p>After the swimming leg of the Stissing Triathlon on the morning of June 21, three volunteers from the Stissing Lake Association, an organization made up of residents along the lake,  kayaked out from the shore to hand-pull invasive water chestnuts.</p>

    <p>“We found far less than last year, and we also did not find them in any other locations than they have been in the past,” said Kim DeNardis, one of the volunteers and the co-president of the SLA, as well as a member of the Pine Plains Conservation Advisory Council.</p>

    <p>Water chestnuts, first discovered at Stissing Lake in 2020, are easily identified by one or two green, strawberry-like leaves on the water's surface. Volunteers have hand-pulled them each season since then, typically in June before the plants develop seed pods.</p>

    <p>Hand-pulling is more effective than cutting, which breaks the stem and allows the plants to regrow. After removal, the plants are discarded away from the water where they can dry out, Denardis said.</p>

    <p>"You want to try to get the entire root system to come up with it," she added. "It's not hard to pull them out, it's just a little bit tricky so you don't break them."</p>

    <p>Eurasian milfoil, the most common invasive species across New York state, has become prevalent throughout Stissing Lake and is difficult to remove because of its thickness.</p>

    <p>"It's everywhere. It's the main seaweed looking thing you'll see just standing on the shoreline," Denardis said. Some residents use water rakes or hire divers to remove it.</p>

    <p>Curly pondweed has been present in Stissing Lake for at least seven years, forming dense mats that can make activities like swimming and boating difficult in some areas of the lake.</p>
        
    <p>While native plants create balanced ecosystems and filter runoff to keep water clean, invasive species are foreign plants without natural predators that tend to take over, said Zion Klos, associate professor of environmental science at Marist University. They choke out beneficial plant life and can alter oxygen levels.</p>

    <p>Invasive species most commonly enter when boats from other water bodies are launched into the lake.</p>

    <h5>Water quality monitoring shows mixed results</h5>

    <p>Every year, the Stissing Lake Association collects water samples for the Citizens Statewide Lake Assessment Program (CSLAP), a volunteer group run by the state Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>

    <p>The 2024 CSLAP report shows the lake still has safe, consistently clear water, though phosphorus levels have increased slightly. The 2025 report will likely be published this winter.</p>

    <p>The CSLAP report monitors different nutrients present in the lake’s water, such as phosphorus and chlorophyll.</p>

<div class="paragraph-body">
    <p>Phosphorus levels correlate with chlorophyll in the water, which indicates algae presence. Both phosphorus and chlorophyll levels spiked during the pandemic then declined, but have been rising again over the past couple of years at a slower rate than during the initial surge.</p>

<div class="paragraph-body">
    <p>Phosphorus enters the lake through stormwater runoff, lawn fertilizer, agricultural manure and nearby roadways. Native plants along the shoreline help filter this runoff.</p>

    <p>"It's not a toxin, it's a nutrient," Klos said. "Too much of it could lead to harmful algal blooms or an ecosystem that's filled with way too many plants, making it hard for fish and other aquatic life to survive."</p>

    <p>The report also measures water clarity using a Secchi disk, a black-and-white disk lowered into the water until it's no longer visible. The deeper the disk can be seen, the clearer the water. Stissing Lake's clarity measurements remain healthy.</p>

    <p>"That lake is very carefully monitored and we have a very good handle on any changes that happen year to year," said Denardis, who swims in Stissing regularly. "We are fortunate to have such a beautiful lake in our area."</p>

    <p>The best way to prevent the introduction of invasive plants or algae is by cleaning boats and kayaks before they enter the lake.</p>

    <p>If you notice any algae or invasive plant presence in Stissing Lake, you can report it on 
        <a href="https://www.nyimapinvasives.org/">this invasive species database.</a></p>
